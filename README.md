# SQL Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project
## Repository for Achievement as a part of a project at Career Foundry Bootcamp

Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental giant, is pivoting to an online video rental service to compete with streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.  This repository contains the data analysis project undertaken to inform the launch strategy for this new venture.

As a data analyst for Rockbuster Stealth's Business Intelligence (BI) department, the primary goal of this project is to leverage Rockbuster's existing movie licenses and historical data to develop a data-driven approach for the online service launch.

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading:**  Loading Rockbuster's extensive dataset into a relational database management system (RDBMS) for efficient querying and analysis.

2. **SQL Analysis:** Utilizing SQL to explore the data, identify key trends, and answer ad-hoc business questions from various departments (inventory, customer insights, etc.). This analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of Rockbuster's data landscape.

3. **Insight Compilation:**  Synthesizing the results of the SQL analysis into a clear and concise format, suitable for presentation to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.  This presentation will provide actionable insights to guide the online service launch strategy.

This repository contains the SQL scripts used for data analysis, supporting documentation, and potentially visualizations generated from the data.  The insights gained from this project will be crucial for Rockbuster Stealth's successful transition to the online video rental market.
